           	Battery Alexander Partners and its affiliates provide investors the opportunity to participate in cash flowing private real estate investments throughout the United States. The firm targets attractive risk adjusted returns through two strategies: investments in undermanaged real estate in the Western US, and by making development loans to high quality developers with pre-leased, build-to-suit opportunities throughout the United States.
           	<br><br>
           	Battery Alexander focuses on multifamily and retail properties, two asset classes that have historically performed well throughout the real estate cycle. The firm takes a long-term view on investment markets and opportunities, and derives its investment strategy from a disciplined, research-based approach to asset selection. This approach focuses not just on the quantity of earnings of a completed investment, but also on the quality of earnings. Investments with quality earnings are those that perform well across economic cycles.
