           	Battery Alexander Partners provides its investors opportunities to invest directly in private real estate assets in California markets. The company targets above average risk adjusted returns by seeking investments in high-quality real estate markets, with a focus on assets that can be improved or redeveloped to meaningfully improve income.
           	<br><br>	
           	Battery Alexander's approach is to discover, capture and release trapped value in real estate. At the same time, the company benefits from a disciplined, market-driven approach to asset selection, and focuses not just on the quantity of earnings of a completed investment, but also on its quality of earnings. Investors have the opportunity to benefit from the experience and relationships of Battery Alexander's Principals, augmenting their investment portfolio with a carefully cultivated set of direct real estate investments.
