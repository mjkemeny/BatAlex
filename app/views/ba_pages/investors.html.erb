           	Battery Alexander Partners provides its investors opportunities to invest directly in private real estate assets in the Western United States, with a focus on California. The company targets above average risk adjusted returns by acquiring value-add investments in high-quality real estate markets; we seek to buy "Quality at a Discount." The company focuses on multifamily and retail assets, two classes that have historically performed well in high-quality markets.
           	<br><br>	
           	Battery Alexander's approach is to discover and capture unexploited value in real estate. In a typical investment, the company seeks to identify opportunities where the the acquired asset will yield a better-than-market cash flow once value-add improvements are completed. At the same time, Battery Alexander takes a long-term view on investment markets, and derives its investment strategy from a disciplined, research-based approach to market selection. This approach focuses not just on the quantity of earnings of a completed investment, but also on the quality of earnings. Our focus is not only on an asset's cash flow today, but also its expected cash flow throughout economic cycles.
           	<br><br>
           	Investors have the opportunity to benefit from the experience and relationships of Battery Alexander's Principals, and to augment their existing investment portfolio with a carefully selected set of direct real estate investments.
